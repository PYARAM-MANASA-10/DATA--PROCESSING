Project Overview
This project focuses on data processing, a critical step in preparing datasets for AI model training. The goal is to clean, transform, and structure raw data to ensure its quality and usability for machine learning or analytical applications.

The project includes creating scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and validation while maintaining reproducibility and scalability.

Exploratory Objective
The primary exploratory objective of this project is to:

Understand the Data:

Identify data inconsistencies (e.g., missing values, duplicates, outliers).
Explore patterns and distributions to uncover underlying trends.
Enhance Data Quality:

Apply preprocessing techniques to improve data integrity and usability.
Structure the data to fit the requirements of specific machine learning models.
Prepare for AI Model Training:

Ensure the dataset is in a format and quality suitable for advanced machine learning pipelines.
Key Activities
1. Data Collection
Gather raw datasets from relevant sources (e.g., CSV, databases, APIs).
Save raw data in a structured directory (data/raw).
2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
Remove duplicates and irrelevant data points.
Standardize inconsistent formatting (e.g., date, string capitalization).
3. Data Transformation
Normalize or scale numerical data (e.g., min-max scaling, z-score standardization).
Convert categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Create new features based on domain knowledge or exploratory analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate descriptive statistics for each feature.
Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Identify and address outliers or anomalies.
5. Data Validation
Validate processed data for correctness.
Check for consistency, completeness, and integrity.
6. Documentation and Reporting
Document the steps and methods used for processing.
Report insights from EDA and the impact of preprocessing on the dataset.
7. Collaboration and Version Control
Use GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Track changes, manage issues, and collaborate with team members.
Deliverables

A processed version of the raw data stored in data/processed.
Scripts:

Python scripts for cleaning, transformation, and analysis in a scripts folder.
Exploratory Report:

Insights and visualizations from the EDA process.
Documentation:

A comprehensive README file explaining the project workflow.
GitHub Repository:

A version-controlled repository for easy collaboration and tracking
